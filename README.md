# GameOfLife
A 2D square grid cellular automation game in which each square or a cell can either be alive or dead and evolve according to the following rules:
- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies because of underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies because of overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell because of reproduction.

Time taken to complete the project: 2 days
